Things you have to decide before starting: Nothing.


How to install:

 1. Compile the programs:
       % make


How to test:

 2. Create a database from /etc/hosts:
       % ./12tocdbm < /etc/hosts | ./cdbmake test.cdb test.tmp
 3. Test the database:
       % ./cdbtest < test.cdb
       found: 171
       different record: 0
       bad length: 0
       not found: 0
       too long to test: 0
    The ``bad length'' and ``not found'' tallies should be 0. The
    ``different record'' tally should be 0 unless you have the same IP
    address listed on several lines in /etc/hosts.
 4. Try retrieving particular records from the database:
       % ./cdbget 127.0.0.1 < test.cdb && echo ''
       localhost
 5. Try printing some database statistics:
       % ./cdbstats < test.cdb
       slots	      342
       records	      171
       d0	      157
       d1	       14
       d2	        0
       d3	        0
       d4	        0
       d5	        0
       d6	        0
       d7	        0
       d8	        0
       d9	        0
       >9	        0


That's it! To report success:
