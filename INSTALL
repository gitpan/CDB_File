You need Perl 5.002 or later.

It is not possible to compile CDB_File-0.6 if you are using sfio.
Sorry.  As soon as Perl 5.004 is released, I will release CDB_File-0.7,
which will work with sfio.  Contact me if you desperately need a sneak
preview.

1. Create a Makefile.

    perl Makefile.PL

2. Build the CDB_File extension.

    make

3. Test it (please don't omit this step).

    make test

You should see `ok 1' through to `ok 29'.  (Exception: under Perl 5.002,
test 16 fails.  This appears to be a bug in 5.002.  The effect is that
you don't get a warning if you hand an undefined key to FETCH.)

If any tests fail, please get in touch so we can sort out the problem.

4. Install the extension.

If you have built CDB_File as a dynamic extension, it's as simple as
this.

    make install

If you have built CDB_File as a static extension, follow the
instructions given during the build process.

5. If you have any problems, questions, or ideas for future
enhancements, please contact me.
