1. Create a Makefile.

    perl Makefile.PL

2. Build the CDB_File extension.

    make

3. Test it (please don't omit this step).

    make test

You should see `ok 1' through to `ok 17'.  If any tests fail, please get
in touch so we can sort out the problem.

4. If you are happy, install the extension.

    make install

5. If you have any problems, questions, or ideas for future enhancements,
please contact me, <tim@uunet.pipex.com>.
